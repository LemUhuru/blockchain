# Blockchain Challenge

Redesign of https://blockchain.info/charts
Hosted @ http://blockchain-charts.herokuapp.com


### List of design issues
  * Uno
      * Problem: Despite having a sticky nav there is the inclination to scroll and given the page has a lot of information on it, this makes for a visual noisy and tedious search process.

      * Solution: Limit scrolling and visual noise. - A design that removes unfocused information and shows the users only what they are interested in on the page is a potential solution.

  * Dos
      * Problem: On mobile and tablet the design breaks as charts begin to overlap

  * Cuatro
      * Problem: Clicking a graph link forwards the user to another page. -
      * Solution: Open the graph in a modal

  * Cinco
      * Sticky nav is limited by how many options it can display - a sidebar nav would be better for scale.
